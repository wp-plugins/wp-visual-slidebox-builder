WordPress Visual Slide-box Builder is a tool that allows you to build slide boxes visually.
It gives you a live preview as you are building to allow you to visualize what your trying to achieve. You can customize your slide-box with
a great variety of properties to create a very unique and custom slide-box animation.

<p> No coding experience is necessary, everything is done through
the UI, which is very intuitive and easy to use. After you have created your slide-box and you feel good about it you can save it, copy the shortcode
that is generated and paste it anywhere in your Website so that your slide-box appears. WordPress Visual Slide-box Builder also allows you to modify
existing slide-boxes, and any changes will automatically propagate throughout the Website.
